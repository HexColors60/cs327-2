This program has all of the functionality of the previous assignment, 1.07.

This program implements all of the functionality described in the spec for 1.08,
the most important of which is described below.

This program generates monsters and items based on the descriptions stored in
the monster_desc.txt and object_desc.txt files. These files are parsed and used
to generate monsters and items and place them into the dungeon. Certain
restrictions apply, such as when an item is an artifact or when a monster is
unique. In this case, these monsters/items can only be generated once.

This program also introduces color into the dungeon by using the color property
of the items and monsters retrieved from the descriptions, and using those
colors to display in the dungeon.

Lastly, I have added a -o or --objnum flag to the main program, allowing the
user to specify how many items they want to spawn in the dungeon.

For more description of what this version of the program does, see the
assignment spec.
