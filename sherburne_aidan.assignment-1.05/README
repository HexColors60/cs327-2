This program has all of the functionality of the previous assignment, 1.04.

This program adds movement mechanics to the game based on the assignment spec.
Controls are as specified in the assignment spec.
This program also includes the ability to travel to new dungeons via up
and down staircases.
Additionally, this program includes a sort of menu functionality, allowing the
player to display a list of all monsters in the dungeon, as well as their
position relative to the player. This list displays at most 21 monsters at a
time, leaving the top row open for status messages and the bottom two rows open
for future use. When in this list, the player can press the up or down arrow
keys to scroll through the list of monsters, assuming there are more than 21
monsters in the dungeon.
To quit this menu, press escape.
Lastly, this program adds the ability to quit the game by pressing q on a player
turn. This exits the game completely and returns to the terminal.
