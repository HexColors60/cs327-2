This program has all of the functionality of the previous assignment, 1.08.

This program implements all of the functionality described in the spec for 1.09,
the most important of which is described below.

This program adds object functionality such as equiping, removing, dropping,
and destroying objects. It implements a backpack for equipped items and an
inventory for storing more items that are not equipped. Items are automatically
picked up upon walking over them, unless the inventory is full.

Commands added are as specified in the spec, though I chose to implement them
slightly differently. My implementation is as follows:
    'w' equips the highlighted item in the inventory menu.
    't' removes the selected item from the backpack to the inventory.
    'x' destroys the selected item in either the inventory or the backpack.
    'd' drops the selected item from either the inventory or the backpack.
    'i' toggles the inventory menu.
    'e' toggles the backpack (equipment menu).
    'I' displays information about the selected item in either menu.
    'L' toggles "Look mode".
          In look mode, you move the curson similarly to in teleport mode.
          When hovering over a monster, object, or the PC, press 't' to inspect.
          Inspecting a monster will show its name, health, speed, and
          description. Inspecting an item will show its name, buff stats, and
          description. Inspecting the PC will show its name, health, and speed.

Combat mechanics are also updated as per the spec.

For more description of what this version of the program does, see the
assignment spec.
