This program has all of the functionality of the previous assignment, 1.09.


I built off of my solution for 1.09 to make 1.10. Features I have added or
changed include the following:

	Gold		User starts with 0 gold and gains gold for killing
			monsters or selling items.
			Teleporting now costs gold.
			Gold can be used for purchasing respawns. The base
			respawn cost is COST_BASE and the cost doubles for
			each respawn. Upon respawn, the user is given a free
			teleport in order to allow them to escape monsters.
	
	Experience	User starts with 0 experience and gains experience
			for killing monsters.
			The user can also level up.
			Each level costs level * level * COST_BASE experience.
			User also gains COST_BASE * level gold as a reward
			for leveling up.
			Leveling up restores the user's health and updates
			the user's base damage.
	
	The game no longer ends when a boss is killed. Bosses provide more
	experience and gold than regular monsters.
	The game only ends when the user either quits or is unable to afford
	a respawn.

	Light		I implemented lights so that LIGHT items now increase
			the visual range of the player.
