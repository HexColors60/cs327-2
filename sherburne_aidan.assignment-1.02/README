@author Aidan Sherburne for CS327 @ Iowa State University, Spring 2019

This program has all of the functionality of the previous assignment, 1.01.
Additionally, this program adds the ability to save and load dungeons.
Program usage is as follows:
./rlg327 [--save <filename>] [--load <filename>] [seed]

Filenames are relative to the "/HOME/.rlg327/dungeon/" path

Saving a dungeon requires a filename to save to.

Loading a dungeon requires a filename to load from.

Including a seed will generate a dungeon with that specified seed,
except in the case that --load is called, in which case the seed is ignored.

Load and Save flags can be added at the same time, which will cause the program
to load the file and promptly overwrite it with the same dungeon.

As per the spec, I included a place_player method that generates a position for
the player, but I did not display the '@' in the dungeon yet.
