This program has all of the functionality of the previous assignment, 1.05.

This program implements all of the functionality described in the spec for 1.06,
the most important of which is described below.

This program ports the previous C code to C++. All new code is written in C++.
The main structs, such as dungeon, character, npc, pc, and event have all been
converted from C structs to C++ classes, using inheritance where necessary.
Dungeon rendering has been changed to only show "remembered" terrain, as per
the spec.

Press f during the player's turn to temporarily display the dungeon map without
the fog of war. Upon moving or pressing another button, the fog will return.
Press t during the player turn to enable teleport mode. Then, press r to
teleport randomly, or use the movement buttons to move the cursor, represented
by an asterisk, to the desired position. Finally, press t again to teleport the
pc to the cursor's position.
