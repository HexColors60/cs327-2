@author Aidan Sherburne for CS327 @ Iowa State University, Spring 2019

This program has all of the functionality of the previous assignment, 1.06.

This program implements all of the functionality described in the spec for 1.07,
the most important of which is described below.

This program parses the monster_desc.txt file stored in the $home/.rlg327/
directory. In order to parse this file you must use the -p or --parse flag.
Using this flag will parse the "$home/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt" file and
print its results to the console, then quit.
New code files include monsterdef.cpp and monsterdef.h
