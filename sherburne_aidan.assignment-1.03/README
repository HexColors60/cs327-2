This program has all of the functionality of the previous assignment, 1.02.

It also generates distance maps fro tunneling and non-tunneling monsters.
These are added to the dungeon struct as tunnel_map_t types called nt_map and t_map.

The functions non_tunneling_map and tunneling_map are called in the main method and
they render the distance maps, first the non-tunneling map, and then the tunneling map.

These functions are modifications of Professor Sheaffer's dijkstra's implementation in
his dijkstra_corridor method.
